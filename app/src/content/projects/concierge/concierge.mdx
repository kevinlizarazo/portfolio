The magic of sharing music with friends and receiving their curated recommendations inspired me to embark on an exciting project: "Concierge." Designed as a personalized tool for Spotify users, Concierge's main goal is to help you better understand your musical preferences and discover new tunes according to your tastes. 

## What is Concierge?

At its core, Concierge is an innovative tool designed to provide insights into your music-listening habits. It taps into your Spotify data, analyzes your top tracks and artists across various time spans, and provides you with an informative summary of your musical patterns. 

The application is still in its developmental phase, but its future is promising. Soon, it will feature playlist analysis and will recommend new music based on customizable filters, such as genre, mood, and energy. The whole idea is to help you explore music based on your tastes and maybe find your new favorite artist or song along the way.

## Behind the Scenes

The construction of Concierge involved Next.js, React, and Material UI to ensure a seamless user experience and a visually appealing interface. For the authentication part and session management, the application leverages Next Auth. As for the data retrieval and analysis, it uses Spotify's Web API and OpenAI's Chat API (gpt-3.5-turbo), allowing for an interesting combination of music data and AI commentary. 

Before using the app, please note that your interaction with these services is governed by their respective privacy policies. Therefore, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with [Spotify's](https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/) and [OpenAI's](https://platform.openai.com/docs/use-case-policy) policies.

## Want to Try Concierge?

To use Concierge, you must be whitelisted in the application's registry on Spotify, as it's currently "In Development." To get whitelisted, send me the email you used to sign up with Spotify, and you'll be all set! Alternatively, tech-savvy users can register their app within Spotify's developer platform and run the code locally.

## Want to Run Concierge Locally?

Running the application locally requires some setup. You'll need an .env.local file with your specific Spotify client ID and secret, along with an OpenAI API key. If you wish to deploy on Vercel, there are some additional environment variables you need to set up within your project dashboard. 

In conclusion, Concierge aims to help you delve deeper into your music-listening habits while discovering new tunes that fit your preferences. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed building it. Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback, and stay tuned for more exciting updates!
